</h2>
<h1>FGYM IS DIFFERENT…</h1>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hello!</span><br>
FGYM here. Welcome to FGYM!<br>

Believe it or not, it takes just 15 to 20 minutes a day to achieve
 a better body. But there’s a catch...<br>

You have to be consistent.<br>

It's 15 to 20 minutes every day, not just 2 or 3 times a week,<br>
 as you’ll find with other programs. But, <br>
it also doesn't have to be several hours at a time, either.<br>

With ZGYM, I believe the key to success is the habit of daily <br>
consistency, with short, intense workouts, according to your<br>
 ability level (with active recovery days so you don’t overtrain.)<br>

That’s why I created ZGYM — to share what I've learned<br>
 over the past 20 years of my own fitness journey that has <br>
helped me become fit and stay fit.<br>

Come work out with me from anywhere ... on any device ... every single day!

  FGYM puts a ton of effort into creating exciting and effective workouts. Her personality is sunny,engaging and sweet. I started working out with her years ago and I can honestly say I’ve 
never been able to work out with another trainer since. She’s absolutely the best.

  Your workouts have literally changed my life and my physique. I came across one of your free videos on you tube. I was in awe of your arms!!! 🙂 
Yours is the physique I’ve always wanted for myself. I signed up to your membership, bought,bands and just a few pieces of equipment. 60 days later
 with A LOT of hardwork (and eating clean)I literally have a new body. My husband and I are both shocked and impressed at the changes. Thank you
 so very much. On a personal note, I am so proud to see you running your OWN business. You are obviously a hard worker, with 
beauty and brains that didn’t give up. Good for you!!! I will always be a supportive fan. Sending love from California

  Long time subscriber here – I found FGYM wayyy back on YouTube and my university housemates and	I would huff and puff though brutal short
 workouts together with F! The FGym has so much to offer! Not only the original HIIT max pain max cardio minimum time, but now a whole intense
 library for strength focus, low impact, mobility – it’s incredible. Thank you  and team for all your hard work and always keeping it fresh. Beyond the
 scale and variety, I also tune in for your excellent posture, form, company through workouts without any cheesy cheerleading that’s common in the
 fitness world, and most importantly for you great attitude – your workouts always brighten my day. Thank you

  I have been an on and off member of ZGYM pretty much since it started, only cancelling when I needed to save money while I was a student.
 No matter how many times I try to leave, I just keep coming back. The workouts are quick, but still very effective. There are hundreds of workouts 
to choose from, or you can follow the weekly schedule or make it completely your own depending on your goals. You can workout alongside FGYM
 or just follow the workout breakdown. I follow along with FGYM , because I struggle with staying focused without someone coaching me through it.
My reason for writing this review had a bit to do with how much I love the FGYM but I came here thanks to customer support/ FGYM TEAM.
 I was having issues viewing workouts (which has never happened before!) so I sent customer support an email. I heard back in less than five
 minutes. They needed more account info, so I sent another email with all my info and heard back in 1 minute (as per the email time stamp).
 They investigated the issue and had it resolved in just over 20 minutes. Customer service/FGYM TEAM is fantastic.

  The average gym member pays $58 per month, or $696 per year, for their membership. And
 that’s with all the Covid restrictions … needing to constantly clean machines … staying 6 feet
 away from everyone … risking contracting Covid … not to mention working out in front 
 of total strangers.</p>

<p>Sounds fun, right?</p>
<p>
But with FGYM, you get to work out in the privacy of your own home, or wherever you have access
 to the internet.
</p><p>
Getting in amazing shape without needing to get in your car and commute to the gym … and 
without depending on any of their equipment.
</p><p>
All you need is your own bodyweight, and minimal equipment.
</p><p>
You’ll also have a worldwide community of members supporting and motivating you, so you’re
 not in it alone.
</p><p>
And you’re not going to pay $58 a month or anything close to that.
</p><p>
For FGYM — your all-in-one fitness solution — starting at just $19.95 a month. We think FGYM®
 is one of the best fitness deals on the entire internet.

                  I'm an author, movement and mobility specialist, certified holistic health & fitness coach, certified integrative nutrition coach, and
 life coach. Over the past 12 years I've been educating myself and my followers/members in areas of fitness, nutrition and wellbeing
. I was the pioneer of a new genre and fitness style in 2008 that I introduced to the world via YouTube My short, intense workouts
 with your own bodyweight and/or minimum equipment (jump rope, kettlebell, sandbag) became increasingly popular and have 
generated hundreds of millions of views worldwide and new opportunities for me. On this incredible journey I was fortunate
 enough to work with one of the best production companies at the time in Los Angeles and produce 10 DVD titles, publish alote
 of book , work with huge stars , What I'm most proud of, though, is my FGYM. FGYM is basically an ongoing online program,
 where you get to work out with me every single day and learn new methods that will take your fitness and wellbeing to the 
next level. It's like having virtual FGYM in your living room or in your pocket wherever you go. I created FGYM to help you get 
into the best shape of your life, improve your performance, and show you how to improve your posture and mobility to resolve
 pain— and give you the best tools to empower you for life.
